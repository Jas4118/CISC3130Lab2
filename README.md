# CISC3130Lab2
This is my second lab for CISC 3130 section TY9 for Katherine Chuang by Jason Li. This repo contains the original main lab code- Lab2 -, the artistName object class- artistName.java -, the Spotify chart list- regional-global-daily-latest - and the artist output file- Artists-WeekOf09062020.
I had several issues like scanner but ended up finding different solution. I had certain issues where my scanner would stop after the 70th array and keep returning null so I had to start looking for stuff like buffered reader and hashsets to assist in making the code. Hashsets made it easier since I didn't have to order the artist names and it wouldn't create duplicates of the artists. I read through the file regional-global-daily-latest and split the list by comma and take the third part of the string split by the commas. This part would be put in the HashSet called nameSet and my program would check if it would be added.If it was added to the set then my for loop would just add an artistName at a frequency=1. If the artistName wasn't added, then my program would go through the nameSet and find if artistName would equal to the initialized artistName temp and use a setter in artistName to get set the frequency to frequency +1 if it was found. The program then prints the toString from artistsName to the file Artists-WeekOf09062020 and ends.
